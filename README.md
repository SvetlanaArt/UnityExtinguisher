# UnityExtinguisher
Simulation of fire extinguisher operation in Unity 3D (Unity editor ver 2021.3.34f1)


**Task description:**

The fire extinguisher stands in front of the object that is on fire. 
When the player clicks on the bolt the fire extinguisher will be unlocked. Then the player is to click on the nozzle, which will trigger the nozzle positioning itself. Now the player can click on the handle to start extinguishing. 
The fire is supposed to be extinguishable if the player positions the extinguisher well (6s of extinguishing is supposed to put the fire out). The fire will "decrease" when it is extinguished and slowly increase when it stops being extinguished.

What is to be found on the UI:
- a slider that adjusts the extinguisher height;
- show how much powder is left in the extinguisher (total is 10 seconds of extinguishing);
- the fire level.


## Developer's Guide


### Scripts/

**public class [AnimHintEvents](Assets/Scripts/AnimHintEvents.cs) : MonoBehaviour**

Contains methods that starts by animation events. 
Attached to **Extinguisher** GameObject

**public class [**AudioShotPlayer**](Assets/Scripts/AudioShotPlayer.cs) : MonoBehaviour**

Provides interface to play shot sounds. 
Attached to **AudioShotPlayer** GameObject

**public class [UIController]( Assets/Scripts/UIController.cs) : MonoBehaviour**

Controls UI sliders to show correct values of the powder count (extinguishing time), the fire level and also correct the extinguisher position. 
Attached to **UI** GameObject with Canvas component

### Scripts/Extinguisher		 

**public class [BoltGetting](Assets/Scripts/Extinguisher/BoltGetting.cs): MonoBehaviour, IPointerClickHandler**

Handles events of the Bolt getting out. 
Attached to **Bolt** GameObject (a child of **Extinguisher** GameObject)

**public class [ExtinguishingController](Assets/Scripts/Extinguisher/ExtinguishingController.cs): MonoBehaviour**

Controls the process of extinguishing. Uses coroutine to control time of extinguishing (powder count).
Attached to **Extinguisher** GameObject

```
// finds a Burning Object and return position of the Fire
Vector3 GetFirePosition();

// starts the extinguishing process.
public void StartExtinguishing();
  
//stops the extinguishing process
public void StopExtinguishing();

// decreases the time of extinguishing, 
// runs as a coroutine during the extinguishing process.
IEnumerator decreaseTime();

// disable the extinguishing process and 
// shows a hint about powder lack
void PowderRanOut();

// stops Powder streaming and 
// stops the extinguishing time decreasing
void StopWorking();

// counts the extinguishing efficiency coefficient 
// which depends on the Fire and the Extinguisher positions
void setCoefExtinguishing();

// returns the extinguishing efficiency coefficient
public float getCoefEstinguishing();
```
**public class [HandleUpDown]( Assets/Scripts/Extinguisher/HandleUpDown.cs):  MonoBehaviour, IPointerDownHandler, IPointerUpHandler**

Handles a click on the HandleTop Collider to start or stop extinguishing.
Attached to ***HandleTop** GameObject (a child of **Extinguisher>HandlePos** GameObject)

**public class [SettingNozzle]( Assets/Scripts/Extinguisher/SettingNozzle.cs) : MonoBehaviour, IPointerClickHandler**

Set the Nozzle position for extinguishing. 
Attached to **Nozzle** GameObject (a child of **Extinguisher** GameObject)
```
// saves initial points positions of the Hose
private void InitPoints();

// runs the "NozzleAnim" animation
public void OnPointerClick(PointerEventData eventData);

// allows to lock the hose points 
// so that the hose remains attached to the extinguisher during animation
private void UpdateHosePoints(); 
```

### Scripts/Fire/

**public class [FireController](Assets/Scripts/Fire/FireController.cs): MonoBehaviour**

Controls the fire level.
Attached to **BurningObject** GameObject 
```
// changes the fire level which depends on 
// the extinguishing process
void ChangeFireLevel();

// increases the fire level
void FireUp();

//decreases the fire level
void FireDown();

// stops the fire (Particle System, sound) and 
// show a hint about this event
void FireStop();
```

**public class [LightManager](Assets/Scripts/Fire/LightManager.cs) : MonoBehaviour**

Creates a flickering light effect and adjusts the intensity of the light to match the level of the fire.
Attached to **Light** GameObject (a child of **Fire** GameObject)

**public class [SmokeLevelCorrector](Assets/Scripts/Fire/SmokeLevelCorrector.cs) : MonoBehaviour**

Correct the smoke level to match the level of the fire.
Attached to **Smoke** GameObject (a child of **Fire** GameObject)

### Scripts/Hints/

**public class [HintController]( Assets/Scripts/Hints/HintController.cs)  : MonoBehaviour**

Provides interface to show and hide hints with the right language.
Attached to **HintController** GameObject

**public class [Hints]( Assets/Scripts/Hints/Hints.cs)   : ScriptableObject**

Allows to create objects containing data of hints and their event names. Provides iterface to get a hint from the dictionary using an event name as a key.

### Animations/

Animation component attached to the **Extinguisher GameObject**

- **BoltOutAnim** - The bolt is pulled out of the fire extinguisher.
- **NozzleAnim** - Positioning the nozzle in front of the extinguisher.
- **HandleUpAnim** - The extinguisher handle goes down.
- **HandleDownAnim** - The extinguisher handle goes up.

### Particle systems:

- GameObject **Powder** - GameObject containes a Particle System presenting a powder stream from the extinguisher. It is a chiled of **Extinguisher>Nozzle**.
- GameObject **Fire** - GameObject containes a Particle System presenting the fire. It is a chiled of **BirningObject**.
- GameObject **Smoke** - GameObject containes a Particle System presenting the smoke. It is a chiled of **BirningObject>Fire**.


### LineRenderer:

- GameObject **Hose** -   GameObject containes a Line Renderer component presenting the extinguisher hose (it connects the extinguisher with the nozzle). It is a chiled of **Extinguisher>Nozzle**.  

### WindZone:

- GameObject **WindZone** - Used in spherical mode to make more real behavior of the fire. It is a chiled of **BurningObject>Fire**
