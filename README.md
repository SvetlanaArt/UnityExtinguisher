# UnityExtinguisher
Simulation of fire extinguisher operation in Unity 3D (Unity editor ver 2021.3.34f1)


**Task description:**

The fire extinguisher stands in front of the object that is on fire. 
When the player clicks on the bolt the fire extinguisher will be unlocked. Then the player is to click on the nozzle, which will trigger the nozzle positioning itself. Now the player can click on the handle to start extinguishing. 
The fire is supposed to be extinguishable if the player positions the extinguisher well (6s of extinguishing is supposed to put the fire out). The fire will "decrease" when it is extinguished and slowly increase when it stops being extinguished.

What is to be found on the UI:
- a slider that adjusts the extinguisher height;
- show how much powder is left in the extinguisher (total is 10 seconds of extinguishing);
- the fire level.

### Scripts/

public class [**AnimHintEvents**](Assets/Scripts/AnimHintEvents.cs) : MonoBehaviour

Contains methods that starts by animation events. 
Attached to **Extinguisher** GameObject
```
// initialization
void InitEvents();

// starts at the end of the "BoltOutAnim" animation: 
// the Bolt begins to fall down.
public void BoltFallDown();

// starts at the end of the "NozzleAnim" animation: 
// enable the Nozzle Collider so a player can click on it.
public void EnableHandle();
 
// starts at the start of the "BoltOutAnim" animation: 
//plays a corresponding sound using AudioPlayer.
public void BoltGetOut(); 

// starts at the end or at the start of several animations
// to show or hide a hint with "eventName".
public void ShowHint(string eventName)

// starts after using UI>SliderExtinguisher and 
// shows hint of using the extinguishing handle 
// if variable isExtingNeedPositioning is true.
public void ShowSliderHint()

// starts at the start of the "HandleUpAnim" and 
// the "HandleDownAnim" animations: plays a corresponding 
// sound using AudioPlayer.
public void HandleUpDown()
```

public class [**AudioShotPlayer**](Assets/Scripts/AudioShotPlayer.cs) : MonoBehaviour

Provides interface to play shot sounds. 
Attached to **AudioShotPlayer** GameObject

public class [**BoltGetting**](Assets/Scripts/BoltGetting.cs): MonoBehaviour, IPointerClickHandler

Handles events of the Bolt getting out. 
Attached to **Bolt** GameObject (a child of **Extinguisher** GameObject)

```
// handle a click on the Bolt Collider
public void OnPointerClick(PointerEventData eventData);

// handle a Bolt collision with the Plane Collider
public void OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision); 
```

public class [**ExtinguishingController**](Assets/Scripts/ExtinguishingController.cs): MonoBehaviour

Controls the process of extinguishing. 
Attached to **Extinguisher** GameObject
```
//initialization
void Init();

// finds a Burning Object and return position of the Fire
Vector3 GetFirePosition();

// starts the extinguishing process.
public void StartExtinguishing();
  
//stops the extinguishing process
public void StopExtinguishing();

// decreases the time of extinguishing, 
// runs as a coroutine during the extinguishing process.
IEnumerator decreaseTime();

// disable the extinguishing process and 
// shows a hint about powder lack
void PowderRanOut();

// stops Powder streaming and 
// stops the extinguishing time decreasing
void StopWorking();

// counts the extinguishing efficiency coefficient 
// which depends on the Fire and the Extinguisher positions
void setCoefExtinguishing();

// returns the extinguishing efficiency coefficient
public float getCoefEstinguishing();

// returns the value of the remaining extinguishing time
// until the powder is finished
public float getPowderCount(); 
```

public class [**FireController**](Assets/Scripts/FireController.cs): MonoBehaviour

Controls the fire level.
Attached to **BurningObject** GameObject 
```
//initialization
void Init();

// changes the fire level which depends on 
// the extinguishing process
void ChangeFireLevel();

// increases the fire level
void FireUp();

//decreases the fire level
void FireDown();

// stops the fire (Particle System, sound) and 
// show a hint about this event
void FireStop();

// return the fire level
public float getFireLevel();

// return the maximum value of a fire level
public float getMaxFireLevel();
```

public class [**HandleUpDown**]( Assets/Scripts/HandleUpDown.cs):  MonoBehaviour, IPointerDownHandler, IPointerUpHandler

Handles a click on the HandleTop Collider to start or stop extinguishing.
Attached to **HandleTop** GameObject (a child of **Extinguisher>HandlePos** GameObject)

public class [**SettingNozzle**]( Assets/Scripts/SettingNozzle.cs) : MonoBehaviour, IPointerClickHandler

Set the Nozzle position for extinguishing. 
Attached to **Nozzle** GameObject (a child of **Extinguisher** GameObject)
```
// saves initial points positions of the Hose
private void InitPoints();

// runs the "NozzleAnim" animation
public void OnPointerClick(PointerEventData eventData);

// allows to lock the hose points 
// so that the hose remains attached to the extinguisher
private void UpdateHosePoints(); 
```

public class [**UIController**]( Assets/Scripts/UIController.cs) : MonoBehaviour

Controls UI sliders to show correct values of the powder count (extinguishing time), the fire level and also correct the extinguisher position. 
Attached to **UI** GameObject with Canvas component
		 

### Scripts/Hints/

public class [**HintController**]( Assets/Scripts/Hints/HintController.cs)  : MonoBehaviour

Provides interface to show and hide hints with the right language.
Attached to **HintController** GameObject

public class [**Hints**]( Assets/Scripts/Hints/Hints.cs)   : ScriptableObject

Allows to create objects containing data of hints and their event names. Provides iterface to get a hint from the dictionary using an event name as a key.

### Animations/

Animation component attached to the **Extinguisher GameObject**

- **BoltOutAnim** - The bolt is pulled out of the fire extinguisher.
- **NozzleAnim** - Positioning the nozzle in front of the extinguisher.
- **HandleUpAnim** - The extinguisher handle goes down.
- **HandleDownAnim** - The extinguisher handle goes up.

### Particle systems:

- **Powder** - GameObject containes a Particle System presenting a powder stream from the extinguisher.  Attached to **Extinguisher>Nozzle**.
- **Fire** - 	 GameObject containes a Particle System presenting the fire.	 Attached to **BirningObject**.


### LineRenderer:

- **Hose** -   GameObject containes a Line Renderer component presenting the extinguisher hose (it connects the extinguisher with the nozzle). Attached to **Extinguisher>Nozzle**.
